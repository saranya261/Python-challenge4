# Python-challenge4
This project is developed as part of the Code2Xplore 60 Days Python Challenge (Day-4) under the course CSE205. It implements a Cyber Activity Risk Analyzer that accepts a list of integer activity intensity scores and processes them using for loops and conditional statements to categorize each score into Low Risk, Medium Risk, High Risk, and Critical Risk levels while ignoring negative values as invalid data. My personalization rule is based on my roll number: if the entered roll number is a multiple of 2 or 5, all Low Risk scores are removed after categorization, and only Medium, High, and Critical Risk scores are retained; otherwise, all categorized lists remain unchanged. This personalization ensures that my program behaves differently from other students’ implementations and satisfies the requirement for unique filtering logic. The program also displays the value of D (roll number), shows the final categorized lists after filtering, counts total valid entries, ignored entries, and the number of scores removed due to personalization, and strictly follows all constraints by using only lists, for loops, and conditional statements without using list comprehensions, dictionaries, filter(), or built-in aggregation functions.
